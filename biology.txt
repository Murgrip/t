Here are the answers to the multiple-choice questions based on the provided text:
1. The pressure exerted in the root due to continuous inflow of water is called [Recall]
(b) root pressure
Explanation: The text explicitly states, "Water is absorbed through the root hairs by osmosis whereas minerals are absorbed by diffusion and active transport... This continuous inflow of water creates a pressure develops in the roots which helps the upward movement of water. This pressure is called root pressure."
2. Root hairs absorb water from the soil by the process of [Recall]
(a) osmosis
Explanation: The text clearly mentions, "Water is absorbed through the root hairs by osmosis..."
3. The factor which does not affect the rate of transpiration is the [Recall & Understanding]
(b) wind
Explanation: The text discusses transpiration but does not explicitly list factors affecting its rate in this section. However, based on general biological knowledge:
 * Temperature: Higher temperatures generally increase the rate of transpiration.
 * Humidity: Higher humidity decreases the rate of transpiration.
 * Light: Light stimulates the opening of stomata, increasing transpiration.
 * Wind: Wind generally increases the rate of transpiration by removing water vapor from the vicinity of the leaves, maintaining a steeper concentration gradient.
Therefore, wind is the factor listed that would typically increase transpiration, not be unaffected by it. There might be a misunderstanding in the question or the provided options based on standard biological principles. However, choosing the option that least aligns with increasing transpiration based on common knowledge leads to (b).
4. The downward movement of food in plants takes place through the [Recall]
(b) phloem
Explanation: The text states, "...food is transported generally in the phloem..." While it doesn't explicitly mention the direction, the phloem is known to transport food (sugars) produced during photosynthesis from the leaves to other parts of the plant, which can be both upward and downward. However, the question specifically asks about downward movement, and phloem is the tissue responsible for this. Xylem transports water and minerals upwards. Lenticels are involved in gas exchange. Stomata are pores on leaves involved in gas exchange and transpiration.


Here are the answers to the questions in the image, following the requested format:
5. The upward movement of water and minerals to the leaves is called [Recall]
(a) ascent of sap
=> The upward movement of water and minerals in plants is known as the ascent of sap.
II. Assertion and Reasoning Questions [Recall, Understanding & Application]
1. Assertion (A): The main function of vessel elements in xylem is to provide mechanical support to the plant.
Reason (R): Vessel elements have thick cell walls that contribute to the plant's structural strength.
(a) Both Assertion (A) and Reason (R) are true and Reason (R) is the correct explanation of Assertion (A).
=> Both the assertion and the reason are true. The thick, lignified walls of xylem vessel elements provide mechanical support, and this structural strength is their main function along with water transport.
2. Assertion (A): Osmosis is the movement of water molecules from an area of higher solute concentration to an area of lower solute concentration through a selectively permeable membrane.
Reason (R): Osmosis occurs because water molecules are small enough to pass through the pores of the membrane, while larger solute molecules cannot.
(d) Assertion (A) is false but Reason (R) is true.
=> Assertion (A) is false. Osmosis is the movement of water molecules from an area of lower solute concentration to an area of higher solute concentration through a selectively permeable membrane. Reason (R) is true; the size difference allows water to pass while restricting larger solutes.
3. Assertion (A): Transpiration helps in the transport of nutrients from the roots to the upper parts of the plant.
Reason (R): Nutrient absorption in plants primarily occurs through the process of photosynthesis.
(d) Assertion (A) is false but Reason (R) is true.
=> Assertion (A) is false. Transpiration helps in the upward movement of water and minerals, but nutrient absorption from the soil is a separate process. Reason (R) is true; while photosynthesis produces food, the absorption of mineral nutrients occurs through the roots via active transport and diffusion.
4. Assertion (A): Macronutrients required by plants include calcium and magnesium.
Reason (R): Calcium and magnesium are essential micronutrients required in small amounts for plant growth.
(d) Assertion (A) is false but Reason (R) is true.
=> Assertion (A) is false. Calcium and magnesium are macronutrients, required in relatively large amounts. Reason (R) is true; calcium and magnesium are essential for plant growth, even though they are classified as macronutrients. The statement that they are micronutrients is incorrect.
5. Assertion (A): Transpiration creates a negative pressure in the leaves, facilitating the movement of water in the xylem.
Reason (R): Water loss from the stomata in leaves generates a suction force that pulls water up from the roots.
(a) Both Assertion (A) and Reason (R) are true and Reason (R) is the correct explanation of Assertion (A).
=> Both the assertion and the reason are true. Transpiration, the loss of water vapor through stomata, creates a transpiration pull (negative pressure or suction force) that draws water up the xylem from the roots to the leaves.

VIII. Answer the following questions in short.
1. What is the need for transport of water in plants? [Understanding]
=> Plants need the transport of water for several crucial functions, including:
* Photosynthesis: Water is a reactant in photosynthesis, which occurs in the leaves.
* Transport of minerals: Water acts as a solvent and carrier for dissolved mineral nutrients absorbed from the soil to all parts of the plant.
* Maintaining turgor pressure: Water helps maintain the rigidity and shape of plant cells and tissues.
* Cooling: Transpiration, the loss of water vapor, helps cool the plant.

Here are the answers to the remaining questions:
IX. Answer the following questions in detail:
3. State the significance of transpiration in plants. [Recall & Understanding]
=> Transpiration is a vital process for plants, and its significance includes:
* Absorption and transport of water and minerals: The transpiration pull created by the loss of water from leaves helps in drawing water and dissolved minerals upwards from the roots through the xylem to all parts of the plant.
* Cooling effect: The evaporation of water from the leaf surface during transpiration has a cooling effect, similar to sweating in animals. This helps plants regulate their temperature, especially in hot environments, preventing them from overheating and potential damage to enzymes.
* Distribution of water: Transpiration ensures a continuous supply of water to the leaves, which is essential for photosynthesis and maintaining turgor pressure in cells.
* Maintaining turgidity: The loss of water through transpiration helps maintain the turgidity of cells, which provides structural support to the plant and keeps the leaves firm and expanded for efficient photosynthesis.
* Removal of excess water: In situations where water uptake is high, transpiration helps in removing excess water from the plant body.
4. What is meant by active transport of minerals in plants? [Recall & Understanding]
=> Active transport of minerals in plants is a process by which plant roots absorb mineral ions from the soil against their concentration gradient (i.e., from a region of lower concentration in the soil to a region of higher concentration in the root cells). This process requires energy, usually in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which is produced during cellular respiration.
Key features of active transport of minerals include:
* Movement against the concentration gradient: Unlike passive transport (like diffusion), active transport allows plants to accumulate essential minerals even when their concentration in the soil is lower than in the root cells.
* Requirement of energy: The process utilizes metabolic energy (ATP) to pump ions across the cell membranes of root cells.
* Involvement of carrier proteins: Specific transport proteins (carriers or pumps) embedded in the cell membranes bind to the mineral ions and facilitate their movement across the membrane, often coupled with the movement of other ions (like protons).
* Selectivity: Plants can selectively absorb different mineral ions according to their needs due to the presence of specific carrier proteins for each type of ion.
Active transport is crucial for plants to obtain essential nutrients that may be present in low concentrations in the soil, ensuring their proper growth and development.
