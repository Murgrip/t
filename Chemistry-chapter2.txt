5. (c) Exothermic change
6. (c) Both processes A and B are chemical changes
II. Assertion and Reasoning Questions
 * (d) Assertion (A) is true but Reason (R) is false
   * Reason (R) is true. Hammering of metals to form sheets (malleability) is a physical change.
   * Assertion (A) is false. Burning of butter is a chemical change as it involves the formation of new substances (like carbon dioxide, water vapor, and ash).
 * (a) Both Assertion (A) and Reason (R) are true
 * (d) Assertion (A) is true but Reason (R) is false
   * Reason (R) is false. The rate of evaporation is inversely proportional to the intermolecular force of attraction. Substances with weaker intermolecular forces evaporate faster.
 * (a) Both Assertion (A) and Reason (R) are true
 * (c) Assertion (A) is false but Reason (R) is true
   * Assertion (A) is false. Breaking a glass plate is a physical change; the chemical composition of the glass remains the same.
III. Fill in the blanks with the correct words from the brackets.
 * Iron benches kept in lawns and gardens get rusted is a chemical change.
 * Cutting a log of wood into pieces is a physical change.
 * A physical change is a temporary change and is reversible.
 * There is a change in the composition of the substance during a chemical change.
 * Magnesium hydroxide is basic in nature as it turns red litmus blue.
V. State if the following statements are True or False. Correct the false statement
 * False. In a physical change, energy changes can be involved, although no new substances are formed. For example, melting ice requires energy input (heat), and freezing water releases energy.
   * Corrected Statement: In a physical change, energy may be absorbed or released, but no new substances are formed.
 * True. When a candle burns, the melting of wax is a physical change, and the burning of the wax (reacting with oxygen to form carbon dioxide and water) is a chemical change.
 * False. If the humidity of air is high, the rate of evaporation becomes low. This is because the air already contains a large amount of water vapor, reducing its capacity to hold more.
   * Corrected Statement: If the humidity of air is high, the rate of evaporation becomes low.
 * False. We feel a cooling sensation when we put a small quantity of glucose on our tongues. This is because the dissolution of glucose in saliva is an endothermic process, meaning it absorbs heat from our tongue.
   * Corrected Statement: We feel a cooling sensation when we put a small quantity of glucose on our tongues.
 * False. Rubbing of alcohol is an example of a physical change (evaporation). The alcohol changes its state from liquid to gas, but its chemical composition remains the same.
   * Corrected Statement: Rubbing of alcohol is an example of a physical change.
VI. Find the odd one out. Give scientific reasons for your answer.
 * Odd one out: Leaves in autumn
   * Reason: The others (grinding, melting butter, hammering metals) are physical changes. The change in leaf color involves chemical changes.
 * Odd one out: Dissolving a solid in a liquid
   * Reason: The others (fermentation, burning paper, making mortar) are chemical changes forming new substances. Dissolving is typically a physical change.
 * Odd one out: Dissolution of ammonium chloride in water
   * Reason: The others (dissolving quick lime, burning magnesium, burning candle) are exothermic changes. This dissolution is endothermic.
 * Odd one out: Stretching of a rubber band
   * Reason: The others (tearing paper, melting ice, dissolving sugar) involve a more permanent change in form or state. Stretching is a temporary deformation.
VIII. Answer the following questions.
 * The "candling" of milk, if you are referring to the process where milk spoils or goes sour, is a chemical change. Here's why:
   * Change in Composition: The lactose (milk sugar) present in the milk is converted into lactic acid by bacteria. This changes the chemical composition of the milk.
   * New Substances Formed: Lactic acid is a new substance with different properties than lactose.
   * Change in Properties: The sour taste and often a change in smell and texture indicate the formation of new substances. These properties are different from fresh milk.
   * Irreversibility: You cannot easily reverse the souring of milk back to its original fresh state.
 * You have already asked this question (number 5 in the previous set). The reason is that cutting only alters the shape and size of the cloth; no new substance with a different chemical composition is formed.
 * (a) The change described (adding potassium chloride to water and obtaining a salt solution, which leaves a residue upon boiling) is primarily a physical change. The potassium chloride dissolves in water, but its chemical composition remains the same. Boiling the water causes it to evaporate, leaving the dissolved salt behind.
   (b) The residue which remains behind after the salt solution is boiled is potassium chloride (KCl).
   (c) The change is reversible. You can re-dissolve the potassium chloride residue in water to get back the salt solution.
 * Energy plays a crucial role in initiating many chemical changes. Often, an initial input of energy is required to break the existing chemical bonds in the reactant molecules. This energy is called activation energy. Once these bonds are broken, new bonds can form, leading to the formation of products and often the release of more energy. Examples include lighting a match (heat energy initiates combustion) or photosynthesis (light energy initiates the reaction).
X. Answer the following questions in detail:
 * Several signs can demonstrate that a chemical change has taken place:
   * Change in color: The reactants and products often have different colors.
   * Formation of a precipitate: A solid (precipitate) may form when two solutions are mixed.
   * Evolution or absorption of heat: The reaction mixture may become hotter (exothermic) or colder (endothermic).
   * Evolution of a gas: Bubbles may form, indicating the production of a gas.
   * Change in odor: The products may have a different smell than the reactants.
   * Irreversibility (usually): Chemical changes are often difficult or impossible to reverse by simple physical means.
   * Formation of new substances with different properties: The products have different chemical and physical properties compared to the starting materials.
 * Metal "A" is magnesium (Mg).
   * When magnesium ribbon burns in air, it reacts with oxygen to form a white powdery substance "B", which is magnesium oxide (MgO). The reaction is:
     2Mg(s) + O_2(g) \rightarrow 2MgO(s)
     This is a chemical change because a new substance (magnesium oxide) with different properties is formed, and heat and light are produced.
   * When magnesium oxide (B) dissolves in water, it forms a new compound "C", which is magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)_2). The reaction is:
     MgO(s) + H_2O(l) \rightarrow Mg(OH)_2(aq)
     Magnesium hydroxide is basic in nature, as it releases hydroxide ions (OH$^-$) in water, which turn red litmus paper blue. This is also a chemical change because a new substance (magnesium hydroxide) with different properties is formed.
X. Answer the following questions in detail:
 * The three fundamental physical forces that can cause a change are:
   * Gravitational Force: This force can cause changes in the position and motion of objects, such as water flowing downhill or objects falling.
   * Electromagnetic Force: This force is responsible for interactions between electrically charged particles. It can cause changes like the attraction or repulsion of magnets, the flow of electric current (leading to light and heat), and chemical bonding (though chemical changes involve the rearrangement of these bonds).
   * Strong Nuclear Force: This force holds the nucleus of an atom together. Changes involving this force occur in nuclear reactions (like fission and fusion), which are distinct from typical physical or chemical changes.
   While the weak nuclear force is another fundamental force, its direct role in causing everyday physical changes is less apparent compared to the other three.
 * Here is the type of change and whether energy is evolved or absorbed:
   (a)  Preparation of caramel by heating sugar: Chemical change. Energy is absorbed (endothermic) initially to break down the sugar molecules and then further reactions occur, releasing some energy, but the overall process requires heating.
   (b)  Lighting of a bulb: Physical change. Electrical energy is converted into light and heat energy (evolved). The filament undergoes a physical change (heating up to incandescence) but its chemical composition remains largely the same.
   (c)  Volcanic eruption: Primarily a chemical change driven by geological processes. Energy is evolved (exothermic) in the form of heat, light, and the kinetic energy of the ejected materials due to various chemical reactions and the release of pressure. Physical changes like the change in state of lava also occur.
   (d)  Evaporation of petrol: Physical change. Energy is absorbed (endothermic) as heat is required to overcome the intermolecular forces holding the petrol molecules in the liquid state, allowing them to escape as a gas.
   (e)  Burning of LPG: Chemical change. Energy is evolved (exothermic) in the form of heat and light as the LPG (liquefied petroleum gas, mainly propane and butane) reacts with oxygen in the air to produce carbon dioxide and water.
 * Here are two examples for each case:
   (a)  Physical changes which are reversible:
   * Melting of ice (solid water to liquid water) and freezing of water (liquid water to solid water).
   * Dissolving sugar in water and evaporating the water to recover the sugar.
   (b)  Physical changes which are not reversible (easily returning to the exact original state):
   * Breaking a glass bottle. While the pieces are still glass, the original shape is lost.
   * Tearing a piece of paper. The paper remains paper, but the original single sheet is gone.
   (c)  Chemical changes:
   * Rusting of iron (iron reacting with oxygen and water to form iron oxide).
   * Burning of wood (wood reacting with oxygen to form ash, carbon dioxide, and water).
 * When Rohan heated sugar in a China dish, the following color changes are observed:
   * Initially, the white crystalline sugar will melt into a clear liquid.
   * Upon further heating, the liquid will turn light yellow, then brown, and eventually black as it chars.
   * Smoke with a characteristic burnt sugar smell will also be produced.
   This is a chemical change. The intense heat causes the sugar molecules (sucrose) to decompose and undergo complex chemical reactions, forming new substances like caramelan, caramelen, and caramelin (which are brown and black), as well as carbon (black residue) and water vapor. The change in color, the production of smoke with a new odor, and the formation of a black residue all indicate the formation of new substances with different chemical compositions than the original sugar.
 * (a) Yes, rust is different from iron. Iron is a pure element (Fe), while rust is primarily hydrated iron(III) oxide (Fe₂O₃·xH₂O). It is a compound formed by the chemical reaction of iron with oxygen and water.
(b) No, you cannot easily change rust back into iron by a simple method. Reversing the rusting process requires chemical reactions, such as heating iron oxide with carbon monoxide or hydrogen in a furnace. These are not simple household methods.
(c) Yes, the formation of rust from iron is a chemical change. This is because:
* A new substance (rust) with a different chemical composition and properties is formed.
* The process involves a chemical reaction between iron, oxygen, and water.
* The change is generally irreversible by simple physical means.
(d) Two other examples of a similar type of change (slow chemical reaction with atmospheric components leading to a change in the material's surface) are:
* Tarnishing of silver: Silver reacts slowly with sulfur compounds in the air to form silver sulfide, a black tarnish on the surface.
* Corrosion of copper: Copper reacts slowly with oxygen and carbon dioxide in the air to form a green layer of copper carbonate (and other copper compounds) on its surface.
